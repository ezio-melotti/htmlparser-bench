This repository contains a few tools used to develop the html.parser module
of the Python standard library.

* sites100k.txt is a list of the 100000 most popular sites;
* get_pages.py will download 1000 web pages from sites100K.txt;
* benchmark.py will parse the pages and record the time and the failure rate;
* summarize.py will show a summary comparing the collected results;
* tree_viewer.py is a simple tool to display the structure of the pages;

First run get_pages.py to download the pages (this will take a while), then
run benchmark.py with the Python versions you want to compare, and finally
run summarize.py to see the differences.
